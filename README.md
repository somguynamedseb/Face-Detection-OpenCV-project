# OpenCV

This has been a personal project of mine recently that I’ve also been exploring in my classes, details of which I’ll add as the project for that class finalizes. I’ve explored the OpenCV libraries for both facial detection, using Haar Cascades, and facial recognition, with feature detection.

I’ve been testing and developing the model using photos of other brothers in my fraternity as I have access to many high resolution photos to train on and test on. Below you can see some of the test photos I have used in my training of this algorithm.

I have more work to do to improve the model in this scenario as Haar Cascades are prone to noise that is not visible to us. I am currently looking into other detection models that could improve this system.

I am currently also working to make this code work better with video as to be able to track a face with a webcam on motors to keep it centered. For this I will need to implement a form of temporal memory to the code.
